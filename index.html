      <h2>About me:</h2>   
      <p>I am a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/"> University of Nottingham</a>. My graduate work focuses on International Relations specifically with 
         interest in Asian global affairs, targetting countries such as China, South Korea and Japan. At the undergraduate level I studied 
         Chinese language and culture graduating with a first-class degree (w/honours) and accolades including an excellence award. In order to
         promote an easier transition for Chinese students studying in the UK I was a founder and the first president of the Chinese Studies society
         at the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/">University of Hull</a>. On top of this I spent a total of two years in China, one year in Heilongjiang (黑龙江)
         teaching English as a volunteer, and another year in Beijing (北京) as part of a year abroad programme for my Bachelors Degree at 
         <a href="http://english.blcu.edu.cn/">Beijing Language and Culture University</a>. </p>
